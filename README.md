# Supervised-Learning-Regression-Models-and-Performance-Metrics-
We learned the concept and purpose of Simple Linear Regression.
We studied its assumptions and mathematical equation.
We understood least squares and real-world applications.
We compared linear regression with logistic regression and learned evaluation metrics.
We implemented a regression model in Python and interpreted its coefficients.
